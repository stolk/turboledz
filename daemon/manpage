.SH NAME
turboledzd \- Turbo LEDz daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
turboledzd
.SH DESCRIPTION
turboledzd is a daemon process that is started by systemd at boot-time to control the LEDs of the custom Turbo LEDz devices.
.SH OPTIONS
turboledzd does not take any options, but you can control its function via the configuration file at /etc/turboledz.conf
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is located at /etc/turboledz.conf and supports the following options:
.SS mode
This sets the mode on what to graph: cpu, gpu, net, etc. Currently, only cpu is implemented.
  mode=cpu
  mode=gpu
  mode=net
.SS freq
This sets the update frequency in Hz.
  freq=10
.SH LAUNCHING
When a Turbo LEDz device is plugged in, and has not yet been contacted by the daemon, the device will display a scrolling wave.
Once the daemon talks to the device, this wave is replaced by live CPU statistics.
When the host OS goes to sleep, it will reinstate the wave-animation on the device.
.BR
This daemon is typically launched as a service by systemd. To start the service, use:
  $ sudo systemctl start turboledz

To stop the service:
  $ sudo systemctl stop turboledz

To check the status of the service:
  $systemctl status turboledz
.SH PERMISSIONS
This daemon was designed to run in userspace.
To do so, it will need access to /dev/hidrawX devices.
This is typically achieved with the correct udev rule in /lib/udev/rules.d/ directory.
The Debian package that gets build from the official turboledz source code will take care of this.
If you are not using the package install, you need to manually take care of this, or alternatively run as root.
