.SH NAME
sysblinkd \- Turbo LEDz daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
sysblinkd
.SH DESCRIPTION
turboledzd is a daemon process that is started by systemd at boot-time to control the LEDs of the custom Turbo LEDz devices.
.SH OPTIONS
turboledzd does not take any options, but you can control its function via the configuration file at /etc/turboledz.conf
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is located at /etc/turboledz.conf and supports the following options:
.SS mode
This sets the mode on what to graph: cpu, gpu, net, etc. Currently, only cpu is implemented.
  mode=cpu
  mode=gpu
  mode=net
.SS freq
This sets the update frequency in Hz.
  freq=10
.SS segm
This sets the number of segments per bar. Some models have 10 segments. Some models have 8 segments.
  segm=10
.SH LAUNCHING
When a Turbo LEDz device is plugged in, and has not yet been contacted by the daemon, the device will display a scrolling wave.
Once the daemon talks to the device, this wave is replaced by live CPU statistics.
When the host OS goes to sleep, it will reinstate the wave-animation on the device.
.BR
This daemon is typically launched as a service by systemd. To start the service, use:
  $ sudo systemctl start turboledz

To stop the service:
  $ sudo systemctl stop turboledz

To check the status of the service:
  $systemctl status turboledz
